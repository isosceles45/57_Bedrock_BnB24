<h1><strong>Resume Parser/Analyzer ðŸ“„</strong></h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
This project aims to streamline the process of resume analysis and ranking by extracting relevant information from resumes provided by users and comparing them against a job description provided by the HR department. The primary technologies used in this project are Python, Spacy for natural language processing (NLP), and cosine similarity for ranking.

<h2>Project Description</h2>
The project involves the following steps:

Resume Collection: Resumes are collected from users, either through an upload feature or direct input.

Resume Parsing: The resumes are parsed using Spacy, a powerful NLP library in Python. Spacy is employed to extract key information such as name, email, skills, work experience, education, etc., from the resumes.

Job Description Input: The HR department provides a job description for the position they are hiring for. This job description serves as a reference point for evaluating the resumes.

Cosine Similarity: Cosine similarity is calculated between the job description and each parsed resume. This metric helps in determining the similarity between the candidate's qualifications and the job requirements.

Ranking Resumes: Resumes are ranked based on their cosine similarity score. Resumes with higher similarity scores are considered more relevant to the job and are ranked higher.

User Interface: The project may include a user interface where users can upload their resumes, view the extracted information, and see the ranking of their resumes compared to the job description.
